## Financial AI Agent using Phidata

This project demonstrates a financial AI agent built using Phi data, which automates financial analysis and decision-making. The agent integrates various tools such as Groq, YFinance, and DuckDuckGo to retrieve real-time data and provide insights into stock prices, analyst recommendations, company news, and more.

### What it Does:

- Web Search: Uses DuckDuckGo to fetch relevant web data and provides reliable sources.
- Financial Analysis: Retrieves financial data (stock prices, analyst recommendations, company news) using YFinanceTools.
- Multi-Agent System: Combines web search and financial analysis agents into a single multi-agent system for comprehensive insights.
